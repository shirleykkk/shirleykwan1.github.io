  of basic computing that can benefit me in my future 
  careers and personal lives.

  skills during the lesson and practicing as studying 
  in IT can mainly will mainly use three skills,technical skills,
  problem-solving skills and communication skills.
  I hope i can have a visible improvment after next semester.</p>
 <p>My current capabilities are not yet match my aspirations,
   to increase my capabilities,I would like to try more and 
   practice more on it.Additionally,I will ask more questions 
   when I facing difficulties as professors are more experienced
   and can give me a helpful suggestions on what I am doing.

<p>On week 1,we've try to make a taichi in a tkinter window,
  at first i don't understand why isn't it just finished by 
  draw a circle but finished by two different half circles 
  and two small circles. After the explanation by tutor, 
  we understand that computers are not smart as our expectations ,
  we still need to clarify every step for it.
In case of this we need to clarify what kind of function are needed 
  and the expected outcome.

<p>On week 1,we've try to make a taichi in a tkinter window,
  at first i don't understand why isn't it just finished by 
  draw a circle but finished by two different half circles 
  and two small circles. After the explanation by tutor, 
  we understand that computers are not smart as our expectations ,
  we still need to clarify every step for it.
In case of this we need to clarify what kind of function are needed 
  and the expected outcome.
